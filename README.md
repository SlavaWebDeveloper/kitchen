## Frontend for Kitchen Store

This project is the frontend part of a kitchen store, built with Bootstrap 5. The main focus was on creating semantic and accessible HTML markup, ensuring the website is both user-friendly and SEO-friendly. The provided design had some issues, but due to the lack of communication with the designer, they could not be addressed.

### Features

- **Fullscreen Image Preview:** Clicking on a product image opens it in fullscreen, providing a detailed view of the kitchen.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Tab navigation is implemented for better accessibility, allowing users to browse through kitchen options using keyboard controls.

### Potential Improvements

- **Alt Attributes:** It is recommended to fill in the `alt` attributes for all kitchen images to improve accessibility and SEO.
- **Image Formats:** Consider optimizing image formats for better performance and loading times.
- **Code Refactoring:** Further refactoring of CSS and JavaScript code is needed to improve maintainability and performance.
